An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The larvae of the apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage. Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling moths and apple maggots. The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called \\\\\"common apples\\\\\". It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider.
